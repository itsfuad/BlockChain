# BlockChain
This code represents a block in the blockchain, along with functions for generating new blocks, calculating the hash of a block, and verifying the validity of a block. 
It also creates a simple blockchain by generating a genesis block and adding some additional blocks to the chain. 
Finally, it verifies the validity of the blockchain by checking each block against the previous block in the chain.

This is just a basic implementation of a blockchain, and there are many additional features and optimizations that could be added to make it more robust and secure.
